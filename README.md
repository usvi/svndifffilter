# svndifffilter
Tool for filtering SVN diffs

This tool can be used to filter (include/exclude files/paths) of a an SVN diff. It seems
that for example filterdiff tool has horrible problems with SVN diffs.

(Contrary to popular beliefs, SVN still exists and is well especially in legacy projects.
I don't care a single flying duck if you use Git. Gloating about SVN mainly demonstrates
a deep incompetence in acknowledging the existence of different situations, temporalities
and user demographics in and surrounding software engineering. But sure, if you feel like
it, go ahead.)
